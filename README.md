# Mastermind

## Description
This single page application utilizes a Rails API backend to provide the database for a JS frontend competitive game interface.  The game is Mastermind, where the goal is to break a color-coded combination that is randomly generated by the application.

Users can create an account to compete for high scores.  The user with the highest average score is displayed as "the Mastermind".
Instructions for game play are displayed on the left-hand side of the client page.
